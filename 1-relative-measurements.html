                    allows users to browse the internet via multiple devices,
                    such as desktop monitors, mobile phones, tablets and more.
                    Devices of different screen sizes, however, pose a problem
                    for web developers: <br> <em>how can we ensure that a website is
                    readable and visually appealing on all devices, regardless
                    of screen size?</em>

                    The answer is <i>responsive design</i>! Responsive Design
                    refers to the ability of a website to resize and reorganize
                    its content based on:
                </h4>
                <h4 class="list">
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>The size of other content on the website</li>
                        <li>The size of the screen the website is being viewed on</li>
                    </ul>
                </h4>
                <h4 class="third-paragraph">
                    In this lesson we'll size html content <i>relative</i> 
                    to other content on a website.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="fourth-paragraph">
                    You've probably noticed that the unit of pixels or <span class="grey">px</span>,
                    is used in websites. Pixels are used to size content to <i>exact</i> dimensions.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you want a div to be exactly 500px wide and 100px tall,
                    then the unit of px can be used. 
                    Pixels however, are fixed, hard coded values.
                    <br>
                    When a screen size changes (like switching from portrait view to landscape on
                    a phone) elements sized with pixels can appear too small, overflow the screen
                    or become completely illegible.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="fifth-paragraph">
                    With CSS, you can avoid hard coded measurements and use 
                    <i>Relative Measurements</i> instead. Relative Measurements
                    offer an advantage over hard coded measurements, as they
                    allow for the proportions of a website to remain intact
                    regardless of screen size or layout.
